# Documentation for Users

Katalyst Tables provides tools for developers to create tabular interfaces for finding and reviewing data in your
database.

Based on the options that the developer has selected, your table may support:
* Sorting, by clicking on the column headers,
* Pagination, by clicking the links under the table to move forward and backward,
* Bulk updates, by selecting rows and then clicking the buttons that appear above the table,
* Filtering, by entering [structured queries](queries) in the search box above the table.
