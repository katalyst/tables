# Collections

`Katalyst::Tables::Collections` provides a model-like layer for wrapping ActiveRecord collections. This provides a way
for collections to implement concerns like sorting, pagination, and filtering, and keeps track of metadata for the view.

See [getting started](../getting-started#collections).
